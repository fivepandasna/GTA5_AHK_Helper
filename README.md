# GTA5 AutoHotkey Helper

A collection of AutoHotkey scripts that automate various actions in GTA Online to enhance gameplay and simplify repetitive tasks.

## Introduction

This project contains AutoHotkey scripts designed to automate commonly used actions in GTA Online. The scripts simulate keyboard inputs to navigate menus and perform actions that would normally require multiple key presses.

The scripts are divided into different categories:
- **IM (Interaction Menu)**: Scripts that use the interaction menu (M key)
- **PH (Phone Helper)**: Scripts that use the phone (UP key)
- **SM (eScape Menu)**: Scripts that use the escape menu (ESC key)
- **ETC**: Various utility scripts

## Installation

1. Install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/) on your computer
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Make sure to maintain the folder structure (subscripts/IM, subscripts/PH, subscripts/SM, subscripts/ETC)
4. Start the main file `GTA5PC_Multiscript_by_sadge.ahk` by double-clicking it

The script will run in the background, and the configured hotkeys will be available in GTA Online.

## Description

The scripts automate various actions in GTA Online by simulating key sequences that would normally have to be performed manually. This saves time and reduces the number of key presses required for frequently used actions.

Examples of automated actions:
- Calling contacts (Mechanic, Mors Mutual, Pegasus, etc.)
- Requesting vehicles and aircraft
- Activating passive mode
- Opening the internet or camera app

## Greetings and Contributions

A warm greeting to all GTA fans! This project is still in a very early stage of development, and not all features are fully implemented or tested.

If you have suggestions for better key bindings or new features, or if you've found bugs, I welcome your feedback. Feel free to create issues or submit pull requests to help improve the project.

## Known Issues

- Not all actions have appropriate sleep times after key presses, which can cause some actions to not work reliably. This will be fixed in future updates.
- Some menus in GTA Online may change with updates, which can cause the scripts to no longer work correctly.
- The scripts were primarily developed and tested for the PC version of GTA Online. Compatibility with other platforms or versions is not guaranteed.
- In cases of high latency or server problems, the scripts may not work as expected as the menus may respond more slowly.
